# Haskell-DS

Practising some of the data structures in the Imperial College module of Algorithm Design and Analysis.

It was all part of a revision plan before the exam :)

It now contains a peculiar forest-based Random Access List, a Red-Black Tree (without deletion), and a Treap. They are all demonstrated [here](Playground.hs).

## How to Play

Assuming that ghc and cabal are already installed.

At the root folder, execute `cabal repl` (`cabal new-repl` if cabal version < 3.0), then in the GHCi prompt enter `:l Playground.hs`. You can either run the `playXXX` functions to try out each data structure, or write your own experiments in [Playground.hs](Playground.hs).
